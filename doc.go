`zerolint` is a Go static analysis tool (linter) that detects unnecessary or potentially incorrect usage of pointers to
zero-sized types.

Pointers to zero-size types (ZSTs) can be problematic:
  - They carry very little information.
  - Two pointers to distinct zero-size variables may or may not compare equal. This can lead to subtle bugs.
  - The pointers themselves are not zero-sized and might waste memory in data structures, on the stack and in the CPU
    cache.

Usage:

	zerolint [flags] [package ...]

The flags are:

	-level value
		analysis level (Basic, Extended, Full) (default Basic)
	-fix
		apply all suggested fixes
	-excluded file
		read excluded types from this file
	-match value
		only check types matching this regex, useful with -fix
	-generated
		check generated files
	-c int
		display offending line with this many lines of context (default -1)
	-zerotrace
		trace found zero-sized types

# Examples

To check the current package for basic problems with pointers to zero-sized types:

	zerolint .

To fix all issues across packages, unsing an exclude file:

	zerolint -level=full -exclude=excludes.txt -fix ./...
